# ECG Signal Preprocessing

---

## Overview
This is a projectconsists of several ECG preprocessing techniques which are necessary foe ECG beat classification.

---

## Content

- **Data Collection**: Gather a comprehensive and diverse dataset of ECG recordings, including both healthy individuals and patients with different heart conditions.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Implement robust preprocessing techniques to clean, filter, and segment the ECG data, ensuring data quality.
- Immplemeted FIR filters(using windowing method) and IIR filters(butterworth).
