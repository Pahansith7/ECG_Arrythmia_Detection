This is a project I started to apply my knowledge regarding Signal Processing and Machine Learning.

# ECG Prediction Project

This repository houses the code and resources for an ECG prediction project. The primary aim of this project is to develop machine learning models capable of analyzing ECG data to predict various cardiac illnesses.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Collection**: Gather a comprehensive and diverse dataset of ECG recordings, including both healthy individuals and patients with different heart conditions.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Implement robust preprocessing techniques to clean, filter, and segment the ECG data, ensuring data quality.

- **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from ECG signals, including heart rate, QRS duration, and other critical morphological characteristics.

- **Machine Learning Models**: Train and fine-tune machine learning models, including deep neural networks, to predict cardiac conditions based on ECG features.

This project is a work in progress.
